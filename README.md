# QT Frontend
The frontend for my QT chart generation service.

## Progress
Pushed an early version which allows for chart image downloading, but does not allow the user to save their chart as a page, to www.qtchart.com. A version which allows the user to save their chart as a page is in the works.

## The Future
- Debug text field widgets.
- Add buttons for page viewing/creation to the mobile version.
- Fix cosmetic issues with widget resizing (elements wrapping, etc.)
